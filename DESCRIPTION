Description: wtss is an R client for the Web Time-Series Service (WTSS). 
  WTSS is a web service that provides remote access to satellite image time series.
  The R client allows Earth observation users request time series from coverages available in a WTSS server. 
  It provides a simple interface for accessing and consuming satellite image time series. 
  The functions avaliable include: (a) listing the coverages available in the WTSS server; 
  (b) describing the contents of a coverage; (c) retrieving a time series based on spatial location and temporal filters.
