Description: An R client that provides remote access to satellite image time series.
  The client allows Earth observation users to obtain time series from data sets available in a Web Time Series Server. 
  The functions include: (a) listing the data sets available in the server; 
  (b) describing the contents of a data set; (c) retrieving a time series based on spatial location and temporal filters.
