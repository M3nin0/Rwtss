Description: wtss.R is an R client package for Web Time-Series Service (WTSS). It allows Earth observation users to request in near real-time metadata based on coverages available on WTSS. It provides classes and methods for handling remote sensing imagery as time series based using spatio-temporal filtering. Coverages include but are not limited to daily and montlhy aggregated hotspot data of vegetation fires, and MODIS data.
